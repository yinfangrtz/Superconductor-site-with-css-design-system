### Welcome
Welcome to [Superconductor Website](https://superconductor-css-practice.netlify.app)! Feel free to explore my website!

### Overview
Responsiveness and Accessibility: My foremost priority is to ensure that the website delivers a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. I have implemented accessibility enhancements to ensure that the website is usable by a diverse audience.  
Design Systems: The project is built on the foundation of a well-defined design system, promoting consistency and cohesiveness throughout the website. This approach enhances the user experience and streamlines development.  
Modern CSS Technologies: I employ modern CSS techniques, including flexbox and grid layouts, to create visually appealing and structurally sound designs. CSS resets and utility classes are utilized to optimize styling and maintain cross-browser consistency.
